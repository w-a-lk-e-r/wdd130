                    <h2>Basics of Musical Instruments</h2>
                    <p>
                        Generally speaking, musical instruments can be grouped into 3 main categories.
                        String instruments, percussion instruments, and wind instruments.
                        From here there is a link to a page about String and Percussion instruments,
                        as well as a link to a page about Wind instruments.
                        Wind instruments can be further categorized
                        based on the source of vibration that produces the sound.
                        For example; reed, lip, and flutter wind instruments.
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, instruments can fall into other categories
                        such as fine-tuned instruments.
                        A piano for example is a fine-tuned instrument.
                        Each key needs to be precisely tuned in order for the notes to sound properly.
                        An interesting note about pianos is that there tends to be some confusion on
                        whether they are percussion or string instruments.
                        One plays the piano by striking or pressing its keys,
                        and as such this falls into the percussion instrument category.
                        However, the sounds are produced when the hammers of the keys
                        hit and vibrate the strings inside the piano,
                        and as such this falls into the string instrument category.
                        If you could place the piano into only one category,
                        which would you say it most closely resembles?

                    <p>
                        Where can you find the world's largest musical instrument?
                        Luray Caverns in Luray, VA.
                        In this cavern, wires are ran from a console to stalactites spreading over 3 acres of cavern space.
                        The stalactites are altered/tuned to match authentic pitches when struck
                        with electronic mallets which have been wired to them.
                        This stalactite organ has been called the largest musical instrument in the world.

                        What is the world's oldest type of musical instrument?
                        Some claim the oldest instruments known are drum instruments.
