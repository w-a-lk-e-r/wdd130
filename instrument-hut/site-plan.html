        WELCOME
        <br>
        Welcome to the Instrument Hut home page.
        On this site you can find some general information about different types of musical instruments.
        If you are interested in learning how to play a new musical instrument and
        are just looking for some ideas, you have come to the right place.
        Or if you just want to browse around, please do so and enjoy the site.

        BASICS of MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
        <br>
        Generally speaking, musical instruments can be grouped into 3 main categories.
        String instruments, percussion instruments, and wind instruments.
        From here there is a link to a page about string and percussion instruments,
        as well as a link to a page about wind instruments.
        Wind instruments can be further categorized based on the source of vibration that produces the sound.
        For example; reed, lip, and flutter wind instruments.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, instruments can fall into other categories such as fine-tuned instruments.
        A piano for example is a fine-tuned instrument.
        Each key needs to be precisely tuned in order for the notes to sound properly.
        An interesting note about pianos is that there tends to be some confusion on
        whether they are percussion or string instruments.
        One plays the piano by striking or pressing its keys,
        and as such this falls into the percussion instrument category.
        However, the sounds are produced when the hammers of the keys hit and vibrate the strings
        inside the piano, and as such this falls into the string instrument category.
        If you could place the piano into only one category, which would you say it most closely resembles?

        FUN FACTS
        <br>
        Where can you find the world's largest musical instrument?
        Luray Caverns in Luray, VA.
        In this cavern, wires are ran from a console to stalactites spreading over 3 acres of cavern space.
        The stalactites are altered/tuned to match authentic pitches when struck
        with electronic mallets which have been wired to them.
        This stalactite organ has been called the largest musical instrument in the world.
        <br><br>
        What is the world's oldest type of musical instrument?
        Some claim the oldest instruments known are drum instruments.

      <h3>String & Percussion Instruments</h3>
      <p>
        String Instruments
        <br>
        With string instruments, as the name implies, sounds are produced via vibrating strings.
        The generated sounds depend upon a few things such as the length and thickness of the strings,
        and the length of the air column in the resonator.
        Some string instruments such as the electric guitar also have electronic sound boards
        which pick up and amplify the sounds.
        Some common types of string instruments are guitars, violins, cellos and harps.
        String instruments are generally quieter in comparison to other types of instruments.
        <br><br>
        Percussion Instruments
        <br>
        With percussion instruments, sounds are made by striking the instrument or part of the instrument,
        with your hand, fingers, or some object such as a drum stick for example.
        Some percussion instruments, especially unpitched percussion instruments,
        might take a little more patience to learn to master since part of the skill
        is to know the level of force at which the instrument should be struck to get the desired sound.
        Some common types of percussion instruments are drums, cymbals, triangles and xylophones.

      <h3>Wind Instruments</h3>
      <p>
        Wind instruments use air as the medium,
        but the way vibrations are generated differ across different types of wind instruments.
        <br><br>
        Some use a reed that vibrates as the player blows into the instrument.
        Examples of reed wind instruments are saxophones and clarinets.
        <br><br>
        Other wind instruments such as trumpets and trombones,
        rely on vibrations from the players lips themselves.
        These tend to be the loudest types of instruments
        due to how the sounds are resonated and amplified through the instruments.
        <br><br>
        Another type of wind instrument such as flutes,
        rely on air moving in and out to generate vibrations in the air column.
        This phenomenon with air movement is called flutter.
        Now you know where the name flute comes from!
        <br><br>
        Whatever the source, vibrations are carried through the instrument via air to produce the sounds.
