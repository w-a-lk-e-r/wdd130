    <p>Hi all! My name is Jason.<p>
    <p>I'm enrolled in the Bachelor of Applied Technology degree,<br>
        and am taking this class as part of the Web Frontend certificate.<br>
        I work in IT currently but not in programming or web developement,<br>
        I'm more on the networking side of things.</p>
    <p>So far I have enjoyed learning programming and web design skills in other classes,<br>
        and am looking forward to another great class in that direction and learning more.<br>
        I think these are great skills to learn, and even if a career in Web Development is not the pursuit,<br>
        just knowing how to do this stuff and designing websites could be a fun hobby.</p>
    <p>I am looking forward to learning with all of you this semester!</p>
